## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-12

### Added

- **Document Management**: Complete document CRUD operations with add_document route
- **End-to-End Testing**: Comprehensive E2E test suite for API validation
- **Async Architecture**: Full conversion to async/await pattern across all services and repositories
- **Database Operations**: Async database operations with improved performance

### Changed

- **Repository Layer**: All repositories converted to async operations
- **Service Layer**: LibraryService and all services now use async patterns
- **Route Handlers**: All API routes converted to async for better concurrency
- **Database Connection**: Async database connections with proper connection management
- **Development Environment**: Updated dev database and improved reload configuration

### Fixed

- **Repository Updates**: Removed required created_at field from update payloads
- **Main Application**: Set proper reload directories for development
- **Test Suite**: Fixed FlatIndex tests and improved test reliability

### Technical Improvements

- **Performance**: Async operations provide better I/O handling and concurrency
- **Code Quality**: Consistent async/await patterns throughout codebase  
- **Documentation**: Updated README with current project state
- **Dependencies**: Cleaned up and updated project dependencies

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-11

### Added

- **Vector Indexing System**: Complete vector search infrastructure with IVF and Flat indexing
- **IVF (Inverted File) Index**: Efficient approximate nearest neighbor search using k-means clustering
- **FlatIndex**: Optimized exact nearest neighbor search with stateless design
- **Repository Pattern**: VectorIndexRepository abstraction with FlatIndexRepository and IVFIndexRepository implementations
- **KMeans Implementation**: Custom k-means clustering algorithm extracted from IVF for reusability  
- **Vector Index Routes**: API endpoints for vector-based document search
- **Library Management**: CRUD operations for document libraries
- **Incremental Index Updates**: Add/remove chunks without full rebuilds

### Changed

- **LibraryService Architecture**: Moved to services/ directory with improved vector search integration
- **Chunk Model**: Made embedding field required (no longer optional)
- **FlatIndex Design**: Refactored to stateless utility class for better separation of concerns
- **Test Structure**: Enhanced test coverage for vector indexing components

### Fixed

- **Matrix Shape Issues**: Resolved cosine similarity computation errors in FlatIndex
- **Vector Transposition**: Proper handling of vector matrix dimensions (DÃ—N format)
- **Index State Management**: Clean separation between computation and data storage

### Technical Improvements

- **Stateless Utilities**: FlatIndex and IVF classes focus purely on computation
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer with persistence planning
- **Service Layer**: Improved separation of concerns in business logic
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced type hints and validation across vector operations

## [0.0.2] - 2025-09-09

- Repository pattern implementation with base, chunk, document, and library repositories
- Service/repository pattern architecture replacing direct VectorDB usage

### Changed

- Replaced app/db.py VectorDB with service/repository pattern
- Database access now uses repository objects instead of direct database calls
- Improved separation of concerns between data access and business logic

### Dependencies
