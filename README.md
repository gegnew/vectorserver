# VectorServer - Document Embedding and Retrieval System

A FastAPI-based vector database system for document chunking, embedding, and semantic search using Cohere's embedding models.

## Overview

VectorServer is a document processing and retrieval system that:

- Stores documents in a hierarchical structure (Libraries > Documents > Chunks)
- Automatically chunks long documents into semantically meaningful segments
- Generates vector embeddings using Cohere's embed-v4.0 model
- Provides semantic search capabilities across document collections
- Offers a RESTful API for document management and search

## Task Completion Status

1. ðŸŸ¢ Define the Chunk, Document and Library classes.
2. ðŸŸ¢ Implement two or three indexing algorithms, do not use external libraries,
   1. ðŸŸ¢ Exact kNN:
   - Time complexity: O(nd)
   - Space complexity: O(n)
   - Simplest and fastest to implement; most precise and fast enough for small datasets.
   2. ðŸŸ¢ IVF
   - Time complexity:
   - Build time: O(I Ã— N Ã— K Ã— D)
     - I: Number of k-means iterations
     - N Ã— K Ã— D: Each iteration computes distances from N vectors to K centroids
   - Search Time: O(K Ã— D + |P|)
     1. Coarse Search: O(K Ã— D) - compute distance from query to K centroids
     2. Fine Search: O(|P|) - return labels of nearest centroid, where |P| = average size of labels â‰ˆ N/K
   - Space complexity: O(N Ã— D + K Ã— D + N) - N = number of vectors - D = vector dimensions - K = number of partitions
     Where:

- N = number of vectors
- D = vector dimensionality
- K = number of partitions/centroids

3. ðŸŸ¢ Implement the necessary data structures/algorithms to ensure that there
   are no data races between reads and writes to the database.
   - I've used `aiosqlite` to leverage FastAPI's async capabilities and prevent
     data races. This isn't a very "custom" solution; previously I had
     implemented the `DB` class as a context manager which handled transactions
     manually. For SQLite, this is a fine solution, but it doesn't make the most
     of FastAPI's capabilities.
4. ðŸŸ¢ Create the logic to do the CRUD operations on libraries and
   documents/chunks.
   - Most DB operations implemented
5. ðŸŸ¢ Implement an API layer on top of that logic to let users interact with the
   vector database.
   - All endpoints for Libraries implemented
6. ðŸŸ¢ Create a docker image for the project
   - sufficient for development, but not for production

### Extra Points:

1. ðŸŸ¢ Metadata filtering
2. ðŸŸ¢ Persistence to Disk (indexes are currently not persisted to disk, must be rebuilt on each app start)
3. ðŸ”´ Leader-Follower Architecture
4. ðŸ”´ Python SDK Client

## Architecture

### Data Model

The system uses a three-tier hierarchical structure:

```
Library (Collection of related documents)
  > Document (Individual files/texts)
    > Chunk (Text segments with embeddings)
```

**Libraries**: Top-level collections for organizing documents by topic, project, or source
**Documents**: Individual text files or content with metadata
**Chunks**: Text segments (~500 characters) with vector embeddings for semantic search

### Technical Choices

**Database**: SQLite with foreign key constraints for data integrity

- Lightweight, serverless, perfect for development and testing
- BLOB storage for binary vector embeddings
- Automatic cascade deletion maintains referential integrity

**Embedding Model**: Cohere embed-v4.0 (1024 dimensions)

- State-of-the-art multilingual embeddings
- Optimized for search and retrieval tasks
- Consistent 1024-dimensional vectors for all content

**Chunking Strategy**: Intelligent text segmentation

- 500-character chunks
- 50-character overlap (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- Smart boundary detection (sentences > words > characters) (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- Preserves context across chunk boundaries

**Framework**: FastAPI + Pydantic

- Type safety with automatic validation
- OpenAPI documentation generation
- High performance async capabilities

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Cohere API key

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd vectorserver
```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file:

```env
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here
DB_PATH=data/dev.sqlite
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or with uv (recommended)
uv sync
```

4. **Initialize Database**

```bash
# the dev.sqlite database is included in this repository
```

## Usage

### Running the API Server

#### Option 1: Run with Docker

```bash
 docker-compose up --build
```

#### Option 2: Run in local environment

```bash
# Development server with hot reload
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Production server
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000` with interactive docs at `/docs`.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test modules
pytest tests/test_db.py -v
pytest tests/test_main.py -v
```

### API Examples

**Create a Library**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/libraries" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Research Papers",
    "description": "Collection of ML research papers",
    "metadata": {"topic": "machine_learning"}
  }'
```

**Upload and Process Document**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/libraries/{library_id}/documents" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Attention Is All You Need",
    "content": "The dominant sequence transduction models...",
    "metadata": {"authors": ["Vaswani", "Shazeer"], "year": 2017}
  }'
```

**Semantic Search**

```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Assiniboine",
    "library_id": "9f9b0b6d-3671-4f9b-a20c-d9e31cc61dba"
